    <h1>Motivation</h1>

    <p>Our project is to provide basic guidance and assist recent graduates in making informed decisions about housing
      in the Boston area. The way we address the need is to present the comparison of the average minimum wage and
      average house prices in the Boston area, along with the visual representation of the landscape.

    <h1>Visualization explanation</h1>

    <p><em>We decided to prioritize addressing the housing needs of new graduates in the Boston region through three
        visualizations. The first visualization employs an X-axis to compare average house and apartment rents in
        areas like Waltham, Newton, and Watertown, aiding users in quickly identifying affordable options for
        comparison. The second visualization adds multiple views along with brushing and linking. It features a map
        with outlined neighborhoods, using colors to indicate relative price differences. Clicking on a neighborhood
        reveals detailed information for comparison, and a slider tracks post-COVID market trends. So, we have a view
        for all the neighborhoods and a view for the selections for comparison. However, if the slider for COVID
        trends becomes a bit infeasible to implement in d3, we might not pursue it as it is a secondary task in our
        lists. The third visualization also contains brushing and linking. It combines a shaded map reflecting housing
        prices with a table ranking areas by average wage similar to visualization 2. Users can interact by clicking
        on the table to highlight corresponding areas on the map, providing a comprehensive view that considers both
        housing affordability and wage levels. The primary goal is to make it easy for users to discern which
        areas/neighborhoods are more cost-effective, offering a valuable comparison tool. So, by interacting with the
        table, they can focus on a subset of areas/neighborhoods. In summary, we wanted to focus on making the tasks
        exploratory for the users so that they can compare and discover for themselves rather than make it a present
        task.

    <h1>Data Analysis</h1>
    <p><b>Boston Area House Prices:</b></p>
    <p><em>We utilized a JSON dataset detailing average house prices across various Boston area cities. This data was
        processed to create a descending order bar chart, offering a clear visualization of property values across
        different locations.</em></p>
    <p><b>Geographic Map of Boston Area:</b></p>
    <p><em>The map, designed in Adobe XD and saved as an SVG file, visually represents the Boston area. It serves as a
        foundational element for contextualizing the spatial distribution of our analysis.</em></p>
    <p><b>Income Group Distribution:</b></p>
    <p><em>Data on the number of people in different income groups within Boston was stored in a CSV file. Basic
        preprocessing steps like header removal and trimming were applied to ensure data cleanliness and usability for
        analysis.</em></p>

    </div>
    <p>We streamlined our bar chart by using average prices for houses and apartments, eliminating the variability
      caused by different apartment types. This simplification, along with sorting the data in descending order, allows
      users to instantly recognize the areas with the highest and lowest living costs, facilitating quick and informed
      decisions.</p>
    <div class="row">

    <p>The final map provides a clear view of income distribution, enhancing users' understanding of each neighborhood's
      affordability. An interactive feature enables comparisons between areas, helping users to make better-informed
      decisions about where to live based on comprehensive economic data.</p>


    <h1>Conclusion</h1>
    <p>In summary, our project successfully delivered a descriptive bar chart and an interactive map, enabling users to
      compare average property prices and income brackets across different areas in Boston. These tools provide valuable
      insights for potential residents evaluating the affordability of various neighborhoods.

      For future enhancements, we envision introducing a broader color palette to the map to represent data more
      distinctively. Enriching our dataset with additional parameters could provide deeper analytical capabilities.
      Furthermore, creating interactive links between the bar chart and map could offer users a more integrated
      experience, allowing for a seamless transition between different data representations. These improvements would
      significantly augment the user's ability to make well-informed housing decisions in the Boston area.</p>
